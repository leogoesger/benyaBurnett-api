      'Focusing LIGHT on Sleep: Deep-Dive Investigation into the Sleep/Light Connection',
    text:
      'Numerous circadian conferences, wellness articles, and color tuning industry messaging points all mention the relationship of ambient light to sleep quality but fail to explain how and WHY the connection works; until now. With easy-to-understand medical research and neurobiological data detailing the physiological sleep process and downstream behavioral response, this session will provide attendees with the skill set needed to design, specify, and install lighting that offers more than color-changing lights in hope of providing occupants with better job performance and improved scholastic performance. Also, hear from two world-class sleep experts on the current state of circadian research and how their view of the lighting industry has changed.',
